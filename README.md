# Hi I'm Carolina

Welcome to my Control Flow & Error Handling lab for school. I am a student attending SAIT (Southern Alberta Institute of Technology), taking a fast track web development course.

Here inside script.js I have an API interaction and Data processing. I am fetching from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co) and want to give the user the moves the inputted Pokemon have.

## Instructions

When you are inside script.js, open your terminal and input the follow structure:

```
node script.js Pikachu
```

In this you can change Pikachu to any pokemon you may know, and the information provided will match the pokemon inputted. If you don't follow the structure, an error will be given in the terminal.

This input accepts both lowercase and uppercase, so feel free to experiment.

## Collaborations

If you want to use this in anyway, please free free. I am not going to be changing this repository anymore, and will not be collaborating with anyone. However, if this code for some reason or another can be of use to you, you may use it.
